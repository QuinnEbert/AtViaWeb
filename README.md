AtViaWeb is a trivial (e.g. user friendly) interface for managing "At" jobs on a UNIX/Linux system as whatever user the web server may happen to be running as.

Don't complain to me about it being web-based and all the security and user-pitfall issues related to that.  It was developed specifically for a user who understood those limitations (and was gracious enough to let me retain the rights to it).

Things I might do with it at some point:
 * Output results of various system(), exec(), and or passthru() calls made by the script.
 * Restrict access using a rudimentary password/username pair.

This one's a "big-time freebie," so, don't expect too much to be done with it.  I got it done in one morning, also, so it probably has some gremlins.
